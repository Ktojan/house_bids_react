This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

It's a demo SPA-app: an auction for houses - not usual ones, but with "things". They all have some paranormal features. But the code is written without any "dark energy":
only clean and optimized React.js code, based on SOLID rules and other design patterns. All given data is totally fake, photos were grabbed from a free source https://pixabay.com/.
