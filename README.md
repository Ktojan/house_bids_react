This is a Next.js and React 18 project. Demo is hosted on [Vercel](https://houses-bids-react.vercel.app/)

It's a demo SPA-app: an auction for houses - not usual ones, but with "things". They all have some paranormal features. But the code is written without any "dark energy":
only clean and optimized React.js code, based on SOLID rules and other design patterns. All given data is totally fake, photos have been grabbed from a free source pixabay.
